Week 2 Assessment
Hey Everyone! Here is your Week 2 Assessment challenge!

Logic
When the page loads, have a button on the DOM that reads Generate.
Upon clicking that button, append a new container onto the DOM.
That new container should have two buttons, one that reads Delete, the other that reads Change Color.
Additionally, there should be text that provides a number in the container.
The number should be the number of times the Generate button has been clicked so far.

The Delete button should delete JUST the container that button is in.
The Change Color button should change the background-color of the container to red.
The default (or normal) state of the background-color should be yellow.
Clicking the Change Color button a second time should change it back to yellow, 3rd time red, 4th time yellow, etc.

REMEMBER: Do not add in anything additional beyond what is required.
The goal is not to be clever here, it is to execute on the provided instructions.

Assessment Submission
Once you are complete, check your work into a new repo and post it on GitHub.
Submit your assignment through the assignment web app.

Important: You Rock
A friendly reminder that this is simply a way for us to see how you are individually doing with the technology.
If this is no problem, great. If you are struggling with it, get done what you can and still submit.
This assessment is not an indicator of how you will perform post Prime or a measure of overall success thus far.
It just gives us an idea of where you are at.

You are Awesome. Just relax and show us what you know!

Thanks and good luck!
